          <h2>Travelling and Adventures</h2>
          <p>Travelling!!!, It's such a thrill to explore new places, meet new people, and experience different cultures.

          <h2>Playing Basketball</h2>
          <p>Basketball is my passion, my hobby, and my escape from the world.
            It's a game that I love playing, watching, and talking about.
            There's just something about the energy of the court, the sound of the ball hitting the ground, and the thrill of making
            that perfect shot that makes my heart sing. Whenever I step onto the court, I feel like I can leave all my worries
            and problems behind and just focus on the game. There's a certain adrenaline rush that comes from running up and down
            the court, trying to outscore your opponent and make the game-winning shot.</p>

          <p>Whether I'm watching a movie or an anime, I find myself completely absorbed in the story and characters.
            I love the way that visual media can transport me to another world and allow me to experience new perspectives 
            and emotions. It's truly a hobby that brings me joy and fulfillment, and I look forward to discovering more 
            great movies and anime in the future. Some of my all-time favorites include "Pashupati prasad," "The Shawshank
             Redemption," and "All the bright places" Some of my favorite greatest anime is "Dragon Ballz", "One Piece", "Naruto"</p>

          <h2>Coding</h2>
          <p>I've been interested in coding just from getting into the field of technology, and I love learning about new programming languages and
            technologies. Right now, I'm particularly interested in full-stack web development and the power it has to create dynamic 
            and interactive websites. Some of my favorite programming languages include JavaScript, Python, and Java.</p>
