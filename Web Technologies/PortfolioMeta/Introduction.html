            An aimless person is like a ship that has lost its control over the sea. The Aim is defined as a strong will to achieve something. Every person must have a well-defined objective in life. It helps a person to understand the direction of his/her career.Every person has a set of goals in life that they want to reach. To achieve their goal, that person needs to work hard, and aims/goals help a person attain his value in society. A personâ€™s surroundings inspire an aim or purpose. Choosing the right goal directs the person on the right path. Therefore, setting an aim and working hard to achieve it is very important for a successful life.<br>To reach your goals, you need to remember some non-avoidable points that aid your success. A person with eagerness to achieve his intentions must be proactive, well-balanced, embrace failure, stay positive, keep track of your goals, and tell everyone with confidence.he Individual must avoid negativity, seek guidance from others, visualize the result of your goals, and be open to feedback and reset your goal.

        <h1>Achievements</h1>
        <p1>
            Being an average student on my schooling days. I failed to get teachers attention. I had very low self steem in my schooling days due to which I never used to take part in ECA activities. So basically, I don't have any achievements till now.
